## Facial Recognition using AlexNet and Cosine Similarity
This project implements a facial recognition system in MATLAB by training and evaluating multiple deep learning models based on AlexNet using the AT&T Face dataset . The best-performing models are aggregatedand , later extending it with cosine similarity for scalable face recognitionâ€”even for individuals the model wasn't originally trained on.

## Overview
Trained several CNN models using AlexNet as a base.

Aggregated the best model based on validation accuracy.

Removed the final classification layer to extract deep feature embeddings.

Used cosine similarity to measure closeness between face embeddings for recognition.
